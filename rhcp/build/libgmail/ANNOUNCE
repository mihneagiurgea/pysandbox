[ANN] libgmail 0.0.6 -- Gmail access via Python -- Now with SMTP Proxy!

libgmail -- Python binding for Google's Gmail service

<http://libgmail.sf.net/>

The `libgmail` project is a pure Python binding to provide access to
Google's Gmail web-mail service.

The library currently ships with a demonstration utility to archive
messages from a Gmail account into mbox files, suitable for importing
into a local email client.

Also includes a demonstration utility that acts as a SMTP proxy to
allow mail to be sent from any standard mail client that uses SMTP
(e.g. Mail.app, Mozilla etc).

License: GPL 2.0

Major changes since 0.0.5:

 * Implemented SMTP proxy to enable Gmail to be send with a
    standard mail client via (E)SMTP. 

 * Extended standard SMTP class to handle ESMTP EHLO & AUTH PLAIN commands.

 * Utility function '_retrieveJavascript' to retrieve current version
   of Gmail Javascript file. (By request.)
